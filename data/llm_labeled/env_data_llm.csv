Using our platform and resources to invest in the power of those who have too often been excluded from conservation leadership.,1.0
"To achieve this first-ever national conservation goal, we must rely on federal public lands, which cover of our country and contain most of its remaining wildlands.",1.0
"Protecting nature on this scale will not only lessen the ongoing extinction crisis but will also help curb the worst effects of climate change and ensure communities have access to clean air, clean water and outdoor spaces.",1.0
the damage to people and nature from climate change has become more severe.,1.0
"From the deserts of California to the Alaskan Arctic, from the Appalachian Mountains to countless other landscapes, public lands are rich in beauty and biodiversity and provide immeasurable benefits to the communities who count on them.",1.0
"And yet, private interests, and often our own government, have long seen these shared lands as a source of profit for the fossil fuel industry.",1.0
"This is damaging to wild nature and nearby communities, especially those that bear the brunt of fossil fuel pollution.",1.0
"In fact, in the U.S., coal, oil and gas production from federal public lands represents nearly one quarter of our total national greenhouse gas emissions.",1.0
"If U.S. public lands were a country, its emissions alone would be the fifth highest in the world.",1.0
"We must transition away from fossil fuel extraction, expand responsibly sited renewable energy, and protect wildlands that serve as “carbon sinks,” which take carbon from the atmosphere and store it.",1.0
"Old-growth and mature forests are among the most powerful tools for natural carbon sequestration we have, and none is more important than the Tongass National Forest.",1.0
"With its towering old-growth and mature stands of trees, it absorbs and stores more heat-trapping carbon than any other U.S. forest.",1.0
"Crucially, the Biden administration went further, banning all industrial-scale logging of old growth trees throughout the committing an initial $25 million to Tribal priorities and community well-being in the region.",1.0
These restored and expanded protections secure an essential “carbon sink” and set an important precedent for climate-friendly forest protection in the future.,1.0
"We are working to change the laws and policies that govern how public lands are managed so that they prioritize climate protection, equitable access to nature for everyone, and conservation—not corporate profits for fossil fuel and other extractive industries.",1.0
"To build enduring approaches to managing our shared lands, we will continue to follow the lead of Tribes, communities of color, working-class and frontline communities—those directly impacted by fossil fuel extraction on public lands—and others who continue to be excluded from public lands decision making.",1.0
"Alongside communities, our partners, and supporters like you, we will press the Biden administration to begin a rapid phase-out of fossil fuel development on public lands, while ensuring a just transition to a sustainable economy for fossil fuel-dependent states and localities.",1.0
"We will help communities choose the best sites for responsibly expanding renewable energy, thereby boosting local economies and generating revenue streams for state and local governments.",1.0
And we will continue to conserve and protect carbon storage champs like our national forests.,1.0
Yet for too long—and despite Indigenous communities’ pleas to protect this landscape—the federal government has thrown much of it open to fossil fuel extraction.,1.0
Ninetyone percent of available lands in the Greater Chaco region are already leased for oil and gas development.,1.0
"The impact of this is not only pollution that threatens the historical site and the health of nearby Tribal communities, but also emissions that threaten the future of our shared planet.",1.0
"In 20-year withdrawal of federal lands within a 10-mile radius around Chaco Culture National Historical Park, ensuring no new oil and gas leasing or development will take place.",1.0
"For far too long, too many have lacked easy access to nature and healthy outdoor activities—especially those who experience outsized burdens and challenges to their well-being.",1.0

"For decades, the Bullitt Foundation has been helping to lead the Pacific Northwest’s pursuit of a greener future, supporting efforts to conserve lands and waters, promote sustainable communities, and center racial equity and justice in the environmental movement.",1.0
"The goal is to connect the vibrant ecosystems of the North Cascades—from Portland, Oregon to Vancouver, British Columbia.",1.0
"But in order to protect the region’s iconic peaks, ancient forests and waters, alongside its recreation values, the foundation was looking for a partner that understood the complexities of bridging the urban to wild divide.",1.0
"“It wasn’t easy to find groups willing to embrace the big, complex challenges of connecting urban communities to wildlands, including understanding and addressing the deep racial inequities in access to nature,” says Denis.",1.0
"“This is a real opportunity to engage in natural area, open-space conservation, in collaboration with community partners, and to connect that work with efforts to protect the region’s public lands,” he adds.",1.0
As The Bullitt Foundation prepares to wind down its grantmaking in Society is looking ahead and sees the Urban to Wild program as integral to landscape-scale conservation.,0.0
The opportunity to refine this model to enhance the resilience of natural ecosystems and human communities will continue to benefit the greater Seattle region and beyond.,1.0
Connecting Urban to Wild All people need and deserve places where they can enjoy nature and live healthy lives.,1.0
"And with more than percent of the U.S. population now residing in cities, it is more important than ever to focus on green spaces in urban places.",1.0
"But many urban communities lack equitable access to nature, and after decades of discriminatory planning and development policies, communities of color are far more likely to face challenges accessing parks and green space.",1.0
"And we’ll partner with local groups and leaders to connect residents to nature and achieve big policy wins, while leveraging our work at the federal level for maximum impact.",1.0
Urban to Wild will also expand our efforts to develop the conservation leaders of the future.,0.0
"We’ll expand our partnerships with groups providing outdoor experiences to urban youth to bring them into wild public lands, teach them about the history of these shared lands and how to become effective advocates for public lands and conservation.",1.0
"Together, we will build a more inclusive and powerful conservation movement to harness the potential of public lands to help our nation address the challenges of our time: species extinction, climate change and inequitable access to nature.",1.0
"While it is critical in the near-term to keep up the fight to defend the Arctic Refuge, it is also urgent that we lay the groundwork for future conservation gains.",1.0
