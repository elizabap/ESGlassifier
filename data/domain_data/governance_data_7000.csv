"In the Pacific Northwest, Washington State took a significant step toward reducing its vehicle emissions when it passed a bill establishing a clean fuel standard for the state—a victory that capped seven years of work by UCS."
The analysis also exposes the fact that many farmworkers have little or no recourse from working in dangerous conditions because their health and safety is routinely discounted by both employers and the legal system.
"UCS combined this science with action, actively pushing for protections from extreme heat such as an occupational safety standard that includes contributions from UCS scientists and reflects the positions of the Good Food for All coalition that UCS coordinates."
"In September, the Biden administration responded, announcing a “coordinated, interagency effort” to counter the threat of extreme heat, including a Department of Labor initiative to protect workers. Big Ag’s practices lead to soil erosion, water pollution, unsafe working conditions, and a lack of opportunity in rural communities."

"To further reinforce integrity and accountability and provide appropriate oversight, the Board has adopted a Group Authority Matrix which identifies matters requiring the approval of the Board, matters requiring the approval of the Group Chief Executive Officers, and matters which are within the authority of certain members of the Group Executive Committee."
"In doing so, the Board ensures that the Group as a whole operates in an efficient, effective and compliant matter while ensuring that all activities and transactions across the Group are analysed and executed with proper authorities and accountability within a clear framework of compliance and controls."

A unified and consistent ERM framework is used throughout the organisation.
Strengthening our risk culture: three lines of defence The ‘three lines of defence’ approach provides a simple and effective way to enhance communications around risk management and control by clarifying roles and responsibilities.
"VEON recognises that the first line of defence consists of the business functions who own and are responsible and accountable for directly assessing, controlling, and mitigating risks."
Since targeted communication campaigns have been launched globally to foster risk and control awareness across the Group.

"Our Group Internal Control department has established and maintains uniform governance, policies and control standards that apply to controlled subsidiaries."
The Group Internal Audit team comprises the third line of defence and is responsible for providing independent assurance to senior management on the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defence.
"Throughout, Internal Audit conducts its activities in a manner based on a continuous evaluation of perceived business risks."
"To ensure strong oversight of and alignment between the three lines of defence, we established our Risk, Ethics and Assurance Committee (REAC), which is co-chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and Group General Counsel and includes the Group Directors of each of the assurance departments."
"Defining our risk appetite In line with the COSO Framework, the VEON ERM Framework categorises risk into four risk categories: strategic, operational, financial and legal, and compliance and regulatory."
"On an annual basis, for each category of risk the Group Executive Committee, Audit Committee, and Board of Directors define the risk appetite statements, which are then integrated into the business through our global policies and procedures."
"The assessed severity of the risk is utilised by management to determine an appropriate risk response (take, treat, transfer or terminate) which may include implementing mitigations, taking into account the risk appetite."
"Monitor, report, and escalate: VEON’s Group Executive Committee reviews significant risks assessed and prioritised based on the Group’s ERM framework."
"Members of the Group Executive Committee also regularly speak with VEON’s Board of Directors, in particular with the Audit and Risk Committee, to evaluate material Group risks."

"With oversight and governance from headquarters, operating company compliance personnel tailor their programmes to suit local regulatory requirements and operational needs."
"VEON’s ethics and compliance staff report to the Interim Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, who has access to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and reports to the Group General Counsel."

"With this in mind, VEON’s approach to talent management focuses on the following priorities: 1."
Having the right skills for the future There is a significant relationship between talent management and organisational performance.
"VEON’s senior management team is actively involved in the selection, development and deployment of strong leaders throughout the business."
This robust process has enabled the placement of internal talent in key leadership roles.
"From mid-2018 through 2019, 42 appointments were made in leadership roles including 60% sourced from internal talent."

Our approach to sustainability and reporting is guided by the principles of stakeholder engagement and materiality of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
Our value creation model is inspired by the framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and attempts to demonstrate the impact of our business operations and social initiatives clearly and holistically.
Reporting scope VEON’s Sustainability Report covers the calendar year.
"Our scope of reporting does not include markets where businesses were sold during the financial year, businesses where we control less than have management control, or businesses that represent less than 0.15% of our service revenue."
The prioritised issues are discussed with the relevant members of the management and the Global Executive Committee.
The materiality assessment and its outcomes are applicable to all entities explained in the Reporting Scope.
Reporting guidelines This report has been prepared in accordance with GRI Standards: Core option.
"Moreover, we include specific elements of the IIRC Framework, for example a value creation model."
We have described the reporting scope and boundaries for each material topics in the GRI Content Index which can also be found on our website.
"The sustainability reporting system is integrated into our broader financial reporting system, including internal controls."
Each year we perform a comprehensive internal check on our KPIs and update our reporting procedures to ensure that our indicators are most relevant to our business.
These changes in processes are updated in our Sustainability Reporting Manual.
The manual is an important internal document for key points of contact at both our operating companies and headquarters.
"Within the Sustainability Programme Framework, we continue to report on the goals identified in the prior year’s report and report on KPIs such as the number of start-ups supported on a cumulative basis."
We have combined the indicator reporting on the number of individuals benefitting from subsidised internet connections versus the number benefitting from ICT equipment in order to reduce double-counting and allow for more robust reporting.
"The UN Sustainable Development Goals Reporting on our impact on and progress regarding the UN Sustainable Development Goals helps us to showcase how our individual sustainability programmes and initiatives contribute to wider global goals around inclusive, environmentally and ethically sound advancement."
"Additionally, it also brings our reporting in line with industry best practices."
The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are the most widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting.
"The GRI Standards are designed to be used by organisations to understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social well-being."
Aligning our reporting with the GRI Standards provides a holistic picture of both our sustainability programmes and our wider business.
"The GRI Standards help us to showcase how VEON empowers local communities and helps to safeguard the environment, while at the same time thriving economically through improving governance and stakeholder relations, enhancing reputations and building trust."
The GRI Standards also help us to contribute to a sustainable global economy by driving greater transparency in corporate reporting and communications.
The Dutch Transparency Benchmark The Dutch Transparency Benchmark assesses transparency in corporate social reporting.
It is a study of the qualitative and quantitative development of corporate social reporting among the largest companies in the Netherlands.
"The government of the Netherlands, where VEON is headquartered, requires companies to be transparent about their corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and activities."
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy uses the Transparency Benchmark to provide an insight into the manner in which the largest Dutch companies report their CSR activities.
Sustainability reporting-related information as well as nonfinancial data is retrieved from each of the operating companies during the process of data collection.
"Third party data Across our reporting process for the Group sustainability report, we do not intend to report on the broader impacts of outsourcing partners or suppliers as these issues should be included in their own sustainability reporting."
company methods Each year we update and streamline the KPI reporting definitions in our Group Sustainability Reporting Manual.
"However, we acknowledge that KPI reporting in some instances cannot be completely aligned, as the definitions of certain indicators inevitably vary per country and across some operating companies."
"Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to obtain assurance over whether the Subject Matter has been prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria and to report to VEON in the form of an independent assurance conclusion, based on the work performed and the evidence obtained."
This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain a specified level of assurance.
"We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusions, on any other information outside of the Subject Matter that may be published in the Report or on VEON’s website for the current reporting period or for previous periods."
"Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, in our opinion, the Subject Matter is fairly stated and has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria."
Our observations We provide our observations and areas for improvement in a separate report to VEON’s Management team.
The Report allows stakeholders to form an understanding of VEON’s response to the current most material issues at a corporate level.
"VEON have sought the views of both internal and external stakeholders in relation to key areas of sustainability management, and there is evidence of an increasing focus on the expectations of investors and other external opinion formers."
We are not aware of any matters that would lead us to conclude that VEON has not reported information on its responses to stakeholder concerns of material significance at a corporate level.
"VEON’s responsibilities also include maintaining effective internal controls over the information and data, resulting in the preparation of the Subject Matter in a way that is free from material misstatements."
"Scope of engagement Challenge Sustainability Limited (“Challenge Sustainability”, “us” or “we”) were commissioned by VEON Amsterdam B.V.

Doing the right thing includes taking care of our environment and what kind of food we source from our suppliers and serve to our customers.
"While we have taken important steps in this field, such as transitioning towards e-delivery and natural ingredients, we increasingly recognised that we not only need to do the right thing, but to also be transparent about our efforts and the outcomes of these efforts."
"It also reflects that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is an ongoing journey for our company, with a commitment to continuous improvement in everything we do."
We understand there is an increasing desire to have a sustainability report presented in one of the established reporting frameworks.

"BUSINESS UNITS Most functions conduct their own procurement, with oversight from Finance and Corporate, and report on operations through established management channels."
"In relation to our franchise stores, it is our strong preference to recruit franchisees from internal candidates."
"We nevertheless ensure we apply standard screening and onboarding procedures, which includes a franchisee training program, to all candidates."
Our franchisee agreements mandate compliance with respective market labour legislation and standards.
"We also have monitoring and audit procedures in place that, for instance, monitor if a store complies with our food quality standards."

Crucial to this is building an ESG governance structure that enables us to put our ambition into practice.

"♦ Establishing robust reporting structures for work related incidents (from our offices, corporate stores to franchisees) to gain confidence that all incidents are captured and reported."
"♦ Undertaking risk assessments and updating when necessary. ♦ Undertaking internal and external audits of the safety management system, and reporting on the number and percentage of employees covered by the system."
We support freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining for all our employees.
"Since franchisees and within our corporate-owned stores to reduce the risk of labour rights issues in our operations, including underpayment."
Our franchisees are required to operate in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and to uphold the Domino’s brand values as part of our agreement with them.
The Sub-Franchisee Agreement mandates compliance with employment law and we provide training in accordance with these laws.
We conduct regular inspections in our stores to ensure the (franchise) stores meet our strict compliance criteria.
The table below shows the number of inspections and compliance breaches in the last two years.
It is important to note that not all compliance breaches relate to the deliberate underpayment of wage.
"However, Domino’s intends to be best practice in our industry, so each is taken seriously and addressed as part of the compliance program."
"We provide secure employment When it comes to business structure and staffing requirements, we work within legislative frameworks around business restructuring."
We are working towards a global HR solution that will enable us to report on turnover using common levels and coverage of our head office and corporate store team members.
At present our systems are disaggregated and we are unable to report this data using a common framework.
"Franchisee sustainability and profitability is at the core of this approach, and Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd management and the Board receive regular updates on franchisee profitability."
"This year, management in Australia/ New Zealand determined additional incentives would be established to reward franchisees determined to grow their store networks as is further explained in the case study on our Ignite Project."
"Reinvestment in our franchisees illustrates Domino’s dedication to live by our Values: to help people grow and prosper, invest to create devotion, and do the right thing, because it’s the right thing to do."
"A simple process of continual evaluation and refinement, coupled with the desire to consistently transform the most challenging products to a clean-label standard, have been key to the progress of this initiative."
We have rigorous processes in place to identify any food quality issues (even where not a food safety issue).
"Domino’s does not audit indirect suppliers, however, our suppliers require their own suppliers to have HACCP/Food Safety Certifications in place."
"Domino’s approach to non-compliance, is that where problems are detected, automatic termination of contracts is not the best outcome."
Domino’s response in the first instance is to work with suppliers to rectify any non-compliance issues identified through regular audits.
"Reporting on incidents and their follow-up is part of Domino’s recall plans and where non-compliance is identified, all suppliers and distribution centres have recall procedures in place."
Animal welfare Our BP Code of Conduct outlines our strong expectations of our suppliers when it comes to animal welfare.
animal welfare measures that are better than industry standard.
"Next steps We want to ensure a global standard for animal welfare across our business, and next year intend to formulate our vision across all of the animal proteins on our menu, starting with Europe where we intend to develop animal welfare standards for pork, beef and tuna."
"Domino’s does not market to children, and this is reflected in our company policy."
"Our management approach to ensuring our customers receive a world class experience involves: ♦ Innovating service offerings to meet changing customer expectations ♦ Committing to respond to customer complaints This financial year we commenced integration with Critizr as a single, global platform to manage all customer feedback."
"Targeted alerting and reporting allow for greater focus on improving customer satisfaction, responsivity, and retention."
"For the first time we are also collecting feedback in a globally aligned way and have made updates to our feedback collection to improve internal and external benchmarking, and for greater insights into the reasons behind the feedback."
Customer ESG survey A crucial step in doing the right thing for our customers is to better understand their expectations of us in the field of ESG.
"The survey confirms that we are taking the right actions with our current ESG efforts, but an important point of attention for us moving forward in our ESG journey is to find ways to better communicate our our ESG initiatives to our customers as they are not well-known."
"In our last report, we outlined that Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd is aligned to the NIST CSF Version 1.1 (CyberSecurity Framework)."
♦ Enhancing our capability for managing the security of data with data mapping exercises conducted across the group and ensuring that appropriate governance is put in-place to protect any sensitive data.
"♦ Enforcing password complexity both technically and in policy, with regular reviews to ensure that only ‘good’ passwords are utilised."
"Due to our strict data security policy and systems, we did not have any information security breaches or other security breaches, including those related to customer personally identifiable information, this financial year."
"Cyber and data security is the responsibility of every team member, senior management, and the Board."
Cyber Risks are communicated to the board and senior leadership team either directly or via the Group CFO via either quarterly or half yearly reporting with a cyber maturity presentation to the board on a yearly basis.
"CyberInsurance is an essential part of an organisation’s disaster recovery in the event of a cyber-attack – Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd works closely with our insurance provider to ensure they are informed about our risk profile and to share best practice in this continually, and rapidly, evolving space."
"Equally, it’s important when customers receive an email purportedly from Domino’s that it’s actually sent by our teams, not by someone pretending to be Domino’s – a significant issue in the online retail world."
"To further strengthen and structure our commitment, we initiated a global corporate footprint baseline measurement project this year."
"Corporate footprint baseline measurement In May we started our corporate footprint baseline measurement project, which is coordinated by our external partner Quantis."
"The project includes a hotspot assessment, footprint measurement, the development of a climate strategy and roadmap, and internal communication and engagement program."
"become a key issue for consumers and investors, driven by scientific research results that underline the importance of restoring nature."
"After overcoming a few obstacles, a suitable, foldable crate was found that had the right dimensions and was light enough for staff to carry."
The program places Domino’s Australia well ahead of the Australian Government’s National Waste Policy Action Plan deadline of and unnecessary plastics will cease.
"It generated a positive shift in perception of our brand in Japan as it showed our commitment to our value of ‘Doing the right thing, because it is the right thing to do’, see case study."
This will include a global framework for donations and guidelines and criteria for markets initiatives.
"It identified that this framework extends beyond a singular focus on the environment, or ‘green’ initiatives."
"♦ We will review our peer group, to identify any areas considered best practice, to ensure that Domino’s always aims to be a leader in our field."
"Ultimately, this may lead to a further prioritisation of material topics and targets per region."
"Our ESG vision needs to be aligned with our Purpose and Values and our key internal and external stakeholders, including our franchisees, customers and investors."
"This year marked the start of reporting on our ESG data, so while we do not have a complete overview of all relevant data yet, it is our intention to further improve our ESG data collection and overall baseline measurement next year."
"Understanding that the ESG field is relatively new for us, we want to further strengthen our understanding of the current and upcoming legislative requirements on ESG related topics and risk management in all of our markets and our global value chain."
next year we will roll out an internal ESG engagement program.

Our culture of integrity is a distinct competitive advantage and allows us to attract and maintain a highperforming workforce.
Our purpose is to drive integrity by being honest and transparent in every interaction.
"We expect each associate to make sound ethical decisions, and we hold ourselves collectively accountable to follow through on these expectations."
"What emerges from these efforts is a unique and personalized car-buying and selling experience, supported by a culture that empowers and inspires associates to strive for ethical excellence every day."
"CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT We are dedicated to protecting our culture of integrity, one of our most valuable corporate assets, by supporting the success of our compliance and ethics program."
Our Code of Business Conduct is the cornerstone of our compliance and ethics program and applies to all CarMax associates and Board members.
"Upon hire and annually thereafter, each associate is required to successfully complete Code of Business Conduct training and certify compliance."

"As part of our approach to risk management, relevant risk factors are considered an integral component of our decision-making processes related to overall business strategy."
"Our risk governance framework is designed to: ► Uncover, categorize, and evaluate risks across the enterprise; ► Identify critical risks; ► Allocate responsibilities for overseeing those risks to the Board and its committees; and ► Evaluate the Company’s risk management process."
Processes to ensure effective management of enterprise-level risks are deeply embedded into our organization and have the direct attention and oversight of both management and the Board.
Our internal Risk Committee is comprised of senior leaders from all facets of business operations and is led by our CFO.
"This Risk Committee meets on a quarterly basis to review and rank our risks, while our CFO meets with the Audit Committee of the Board on an annual basis to discuss the procedures for identifying and mitigating significant risk."
The risks identified by the internal Risk Committee are presented to our Board semiannually.
"Additionally, our Board has its own enterprise risk management function that reviews enterprise-wide risks in the aggregate in order to allocate oversight appropriately among the various committees and where necessary, the entire Board."
"To drive continuity and alignment, a formal tracking mechanism has been implemented to ensure risks identified by both management and the Board are reviewed on a quarterly basis and addressed appropriately."
Our Compliance and Ethics (“C&E”) program is led by our Chief Compliance Officer who reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board.
"As part of our focus on continuous improvement, the C&E and CarMax Auto Finance Compliance teams recently merged."
"The merged team provides a holistic view and approach for regulatory compliance risk management across the enterprise, resulting in a more efficient and effective program."
"Additionally, we leverage over leaders across the organization to serve as Compliance Administrators and support compliance initiatives, further embed compliance within our business, and help drive and sustain compliance Company-wide."

"We drive our compliance through our commitment to lawful conduct and recognize that any violation of the law could compromise our culture of, and reputation for, integrity."
"Therefore, we expect our Board, management, associates, and business partners to operate in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we monitor our own efforts in several ways: ► Our annual Company-wide Risk Assessment, wherein our Compliance Administrators work alongside our Compliance team to critically evaluate strengths, successes, challenges, and opportunities with respect to compliance with the legal requirements applicable to the business."
The results of the assessment ultimately drive our compliance efforts over the course of the following year.
"► Our Store Compliance Review program, which supports store-level compliance in all geographies."
"We evaluate execution across our store base, as well as appropriately and collaboratively address, resolve, and monitor store-specific issues to help ensure ongoing store compliance."

"collaboratively with business leaders to detect, address, and resolve identified issues to help ensure ongoing compliance."
"► Our CarMax Auto Finance Compliance Management System (“CMS”), which is designed to prevent, detect, and correct practices that violate statutes, regulations, laws, or Company policy, and mitigate consumer harm in connection with offering and servicing consumer financial products and services."
"► Our Automation and Analytics program, which leverages data to enhance compliance risk coverage and increase efficiency."
"These practices allow for centralization, systematized detection, and, at times, notification of transactions with potential compliance risk."
"We leverage automation and analytical capabilities to support various compliance initiatives, including our Store, Non-Store, and CMS Compliance Review programs."
Our mission is to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of all data and personal information stored in our systems and networks through sound data collection and usage protocols.
"To effectively identify vulnerabilities and remediate risks that could impact our business operations and the integrity of the information we store, we utilize technologies and processes that align with leading industry standards for enumerating and remediating our environment."
"In addition to our internal event monitoring capabilities, we utilize several thirdparty security services that collectively provide a realtime view of our security threat posture."
"Given the potential impact and ever-changing nature of cybersecurity threats, our management team briefs either the full Board or its Technology and Innovation Committee on a quarterly basis on CarMax’s security posture and the latest and most relevant issues related to technology and cybersecurity risk."
"Our security management framework is based on leading practices from industry standard guidelines, including the ISO Information Security Management and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework."
"To this end, we have policies that inform our customers about our use and protection of their information, including General Privacy Policy and Financial Privacy Policy and internal policies for our associates to understand the importance of safeguarding customer information and the acceptable use of electronic systems and devices."
"Upon hire, every associate receives training on our Safeguarding Customer Information Policy to ensure our new hires are equipped to responsibly handle and protect the information we collect."
"Additionally, our annual Culture of Integrity training program includes specialized topics on data security and consumer privacy."
We have also developed specialized training for key areas of the business to ensure the right individuals receive appropriate security awareness training.

"This work has initially focused on three key areas: our Management Trainee program, our Advanced Management Partners, and our leadership positions."

"Further, our Employee Assistance Program provides complimentary access to counseling for mental health, legal, and financial issues."
Contributions are approved by the Board of Directors based on the company’s financial performance and are distributed based on a point system weighted by an employeepartner’s company tenure and compensation.

"In addition, these employeepartners can also participate in division-specific bootcamps to gain the knowledge they need to lead other employee-partners to success."
Most of the multipleday classes have historically been taught in person at the company’s corporate headquarters located just outside Cincinnati.
"These include our Management Trainee program, our ELP, and our mentor program."

"IMPACT and LEAD were created in response to our company’s growing employeepartner populations and their appetite for groupbased, collaborative development resources."
They also provide a platform for management to hear from our employee-partners directly about the issues that matter most to them.
"We also believe that the PBRGs give our employee-partners a louder voice, additional leadership opportunities, and greater access to management."
"This helps to promote stronger connections to our corporate development strategy and goals, and makes connections between employee-partners across our company who may not otherwise have the chance to cross paths."

These locations must also undergo a rigorous on-site audit by OSHA and third-party assessors every three to five years to maintain their certification.
Locations self-assess against safety and health protocols and undergo routine evaluations by our corporate Safety and Health team.
"Field locations have a designated Safety and Improvement Committee which includes trained employee-partners from across the location’s departments, as well as the local management team."
