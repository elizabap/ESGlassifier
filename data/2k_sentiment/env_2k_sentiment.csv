The report should also address the risks presented by any misaligned lobbying and the company’s plans, if any, to mitigate these risks.",1
"However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formula used to estimate methane emissions is not a good foundation for a corporate mitigation strategy, failing to capture many major leaks, wasting valuable product (worth $2 billion per year) and substantially underestimating emissions.",1
"Chevron set Upstream equity net GHG intensity reduction goals for 2028 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 24 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) per barrels of oil-equivalent (“boe”) for oil or gas production carbon intensity, zero routine flaring by 2030, 3 kg CO2e/boe for flaring intensity, and 2 kg CO2e/boe for methane intensity, along with a methane detection plan.1 Successfully achieving these metrics is linked to most Chevron employees’ variable compensation.",1

"In contrast, Chevron appears to prioritize our Company’s financial returns over the impact of climate change on global markets.",1
"For example, Chevron Phillips Chemical has incorporated weather-related scenarios into both the Process Hazard Analysis and the Layer of Protection Analysis in new facility design.",1
This approach can best incentivize the most efficient and cost-effective emissions reductions while providing support to impacted communities and creating a level playing field that maintains economic competitiveness.,1
Your Board believes that the additional report called for by the proposal is neither necessary nor an appropriate way to ensure the Company meets its social and environmental responsibilities.,1
